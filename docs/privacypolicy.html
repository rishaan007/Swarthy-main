    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: June 19, 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Swasthya Claim Assist (“we,” “our,” or “the platform”) collects, uses, and
        protects the personal information you provide while using our medical claim processing services. By accessing or
        using our platform, you consent to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of data to provide our services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Identification:</strong> Patient name, Aadhaar number, contact details</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Information:</strong> Diagnosis, admission/discharge dates, treatment summaries,
            prescriptions</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Data:</strong> Hospital bill totals, insurance claim status</li>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Files:</strong> PDFs, scanned documents, images processed via OCR</li>
        <li><strong>Chatbot Queries:</strong> Text input and interaction logs with our Gemini-powered AI assistant</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Metadata:</strong> IP address, browser info, language preference</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is used strictly for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To extract and summarize medical documents accurately</li>
        <li>To respond to user queries via our AI chatbot assistant</li>
        <li>To recommend insurance policies based on anonymized usage patterns</li>
        <li>To improve system accuracy, multilingual support, and analytics</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. File and Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Uploaded documents are processed securely using <code>pdfplumber</code> and <code>pytesseract</code>. No files
        are stored permanently on our servers. Summarized results are temporarily cached for performance and then
        discarded.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AI Chatbot Data</h2>
    <p>
        Interactions with our Gemini API-powered assistant are logged anonymously to improve response quality. No
        personal identifiers are stored with query logs.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All file uploads are encrypted in transit using HTTPS.</li>
        <li>No medical data is stored beyond the session duration.</li>
        <li>Access to backend files like <code>ai_chatbot.py</code>, <code>doc_summarizer.py</code>, and
            <code>ins_adv.py</code> is restricted and secured.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We may use third-party APIs such as Google Gemini and IRDAI public data sources. These services have their own
        privacy terms. We ensure data passed to them is minimal and secure.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can request deletion of all uploaded files and chatbot history.</li>
        <li>You may opt out of chatbot data logging for improvement purposes.</li>
        <li>We do not share or sell any data to advertisers or third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Users will be notified of changes via platform banners or email
        (if provided).
    </p>
